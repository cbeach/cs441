This program uses a depth first search algorithm to prove that connect three on a 4X3 board is a draw.
I use an implementation of the minimax algorithm to get this result.

Run it with...

make && ./ad

And it will tell you that a game on a 4X3 board is a draw.

This program was developed and run on the computers in the linux lab in fab8810.

Enjoy.
